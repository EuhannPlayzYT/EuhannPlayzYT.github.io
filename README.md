Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, rgh. "Sorcery Battle") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018, with its chapters collected and published in 24 tankōbon volumes as of October 2023. The story is about how our main character, Yuji Itadori, a once normal highschool student joins a secret Jujutsu Sorcerer organization which aims to battle curses.

## **Storyline**
Yuji is a member of a "Paranormal Activity" club in his highschool. He and his friends find a mysterious box which contains a Special Grade Cursed Object (but they don't know that yet) Yuji then runs into a student of Jujutsu High, Megumi Fushiguro. Megumi senses the cursed energy of the object and hurriedly chases after Yuji. When he caught up however, he realized that the energy he felt was just from the box. Yuji explains how his friends will remove the seal on the object at midnight. Megumi is shocked by the news and the two rush to the school. Once the seal had been removed, they uncovered one of the fingers of The King of Curses. Consuming this finger would allow one to become a host for The King who's name is Ryomen Sukuna. The presence of the unsealed cursed object attracted curses nearby. The curses attacked Yuji's friends but he arrived right on time. He took the finger and as he was about to save his friend, he got caught by the curse. As a desparate attempt to either flee or defeat the curse, Yuji decided to swallow the cursed object. Doing this caused him to have a sudden burst of strength. Short after the curse had been defeated, a teacher in Jujutsu High had just arrived. This man is Gojo Satoru. Megumi filled Gojo in about what hapenned and since Yuji is a stable vessel for Sukuna, he saw potential in Yuji. He took Yuji in his care at Jujutsu High, shortly after talking to the higher ups who want the private execution of Yuji since he is now on a high level of danger because Sukuna is now revived in the body of Itadori Yuji. His execution is soon delayed as Gojo stated his proposal to allow Yuji to consume all 20 of Sukuna's Fingers. Yuji now fights alongside fellow Jujutsu Sorcerers with the mission of finding all 20 fingers as the vessel for Ryomen Sukuna.
